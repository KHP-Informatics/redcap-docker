tutum-docker-mysql
==================

Base docker image to run a MySQL database server


MySQL version
-------------

Different versions are built from different folders. If you want to use MariaDB, please check our `tutum/mariadb` image: https://github.com/tutumcloud/tutum-docker-mariadb


Usage
-----

To create the image `tutum/mysql`, execute the following command on the tutum-mysql folder:

        docker build -t tutum/mysql 5.5/

To run the image and bind to port 3306:

        docker run -d -p 3306:3306 tutum/mysql

The first time that you run your container, a new user `admin` with all privileges 
will be created in MySQL with a random password. To get the password, check the logs
of the container by running:

        docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>

You will see an output like the following:

        ========================================================================
        You can now connect to this MySQL Server using:

            mysql -uadmin -p47nnf4FweaKu -h<host> -P<port>

        Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
        MySQL user 'root' has no password but only allows local connections
        ========================================================================

In this case, `47nnf4FweaKu` is the password allocated to the `admin` user.

Remember that the `root` user has no password but it's only accessible from within the container.

You can now test your deployment:

        mysql -uadmin -p

Done!


Setting a specific password for the admin account
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a preset password instead of a random generated one, you can
set the environment variable `MYSQL_PASS` to your specific password when running the container:

        docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_PASS="mypass" tutum/mysql

You can now test your deployment:

        mysql -uadmin -p"mypass"

The admin username can also be set via the `MYSQL_USER` environment variable.


Mounting the database file volume
---------------------------------

In order to persist the database data, you can mount a local folder from the host 
on the container to store the database files. To do so:

        docker run -d -v /path/in/host:/var/lib/mysql tutum/mysql /bin/bash -c "/usr/bin/mysql_install_db"

This will mount the local folder `/path/in/host` inside the docker in `/var/lib/mysql` (where MySQL will store the database files by default). `mysql_install_db` creates the initial database structure.

Remember that this will mean that your host must have `/path/in/host` available when you run your docker image!

After this you can start your mysql image but this time using `/path/in/host` as the database folder:

        docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -v /path/in/host:/var/lib/mysql tutum/mysql


Mounting the database file volume from other containers
------------------------------------------------------

Another way to persist the database data is to store database files in another container.
To do so, first create a container that holds database files:

    docker run -d -v /var/lib/mysql --name db_vol -p 22:22 tutum/ubuntu-trusty 

This will create a new ssh-enabled container and use its folder `/var/lib/mysql` to store MySQL database files. 
You can specify any name of the container by using `--name` option, which will be used in next step.

After this you can start your MySQL image using volumes in the container created above (put the name of container in `--volumes-from`)

    docker run -d --volumes-from db_vol -p 3306:3306 tutum/mysql 


Migrating an existing MySQL Server
----------------------------------

In order to migrate your current MySQL server, perform the following commands from your current server:

To dump your databases structure:

        mysqldump -u<user> -p --opt -d -B <database name(s)> > /tmp/dbserver_schema.sql

To dump your database data:

        mysqldump -u<user> -p --quick --single-transaction -t -n -B <database name(s)> > /tmp/dbserver_data.sql

To import a SQL backup which is stored for example in the folder `/tmp` in the host, run the following:

        sudo docker run -d -v /tmp:/tmp tutum/mysql /bin/bash -c "/import_sql.sh <user> <pass> /tmp/<dump.sql>"

Also you can start the new database initializing it with the SQL file:

        sudo docker run -d -v /path/in/host:/var/lib/mysql -e STARTUP_SQL="/tmp/<dump.sql>" tutum/mysql

Where `<user>` and `<pass>` are the database username and password set earlier and `<dump.sql>` is the name of the SQL file to be imported.


Replication - Master/Slave
-------------------------
To use MySQL replication, please set environment variable `REPLICATION_MASTER`/`REPLICATION_SLAVE` to `true`. Also, on master side, you may want to specify `REPLICATION_USER` and `REPLICATION_PASS` for the account to perform replication, the default value is `replica:replica`

Examples:
- Master MySQL
- 
        docker run -d -e REPLICATION_MASTER=true -e REPLICATION_PASS=mypass -p 3306:3306 --name mysql tutum/mysql

- Example on Slave MySQL:
- 
        docker run -d -e REPLICATION_SLAVE=true -p 3307:3306 --link mysql:mysql tutum/mysql

Now, you can access port `3306` and `3307` for the master/slave mysql
Environment variables
---------------------

`MYSQL_USER`: Set a specific username for the admin account (default 'admin')

`MYSQL_PASS`: Set a specific password for the admin account.

`STARTUP_SQL`: Defines one or more sql scripts separated by spaces to initialize the database. Note that the scripts must be inside the conainer so you may need to mount them

Compatibility Issues
--------------------

- Volume created by MySQL 5.6 cannot be used in MySQL 5.5 Images or MariaDB images
